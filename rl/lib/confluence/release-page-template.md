# ㎝ Change Management


# ✨ Release Summary

This release will include haphazardly thrown together bash scripts calling:

- the Jira API to create a release
- the Confluence API to create a release page
- the Teams API to post an announcement requesting a release
- the Change Management tool to create a draft CM ticket
- GitHub Actions to automate all of the above, along with:
  - the option to this markdown text with the release branch's PR description
  - inputs for:
    - release name
    - page name
  - secrets for:
    - Jira project_id 
    - Jira API user/token
    - Confluence API user/token
    - Confluence space_id (if a team wants to use their own space)
